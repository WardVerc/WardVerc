### WardVerc 🏄🏻 🧗‍♂️ 🏂 

Meet Ward (30 years old), the digital adventurer who lives between the lines of his code. When he's not busy developing new software, you'll find him up high, chasing the next adrenaline rush through wakeboarding or climbing. When the adrenaline subsides, his mind remains active, enjoying building his latest projects, whether it's a website or an innovative Raspberry Pi project in his spare time.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ward's Coding Journey (click to expand)</h3></summary>
   I began my coding journey while trading in FIFA players, aiming to profit from each transaction. Given the 5% loss on each sale, I needed to earn more than this percentage, which soon became tiresome to calculate repeatedly. This challenge sparked the idea of creating a program to automate the calculations. After diving into "Head First Java," I developed a tool within a few weeks that calculated my profits. This superpower called 'programming' ignited my passion for coding's vast possibilities.
<br />
<br />
Motivated, I completed a course on freecodecamp.org in responsive web design, covering HTML and CSS. Eager to enter the IT field, I sent numerous applications and eventually landed a role as a software tester with a company that recognized my potential. Working in this position confirmed I was on the right career path, so I enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program that covered the fundamentals of programming. After two years as a tester and completing my studies, the company promoted me to a frontend developer role in 2021.
<br />
<br />
Over the next three years, I worked as a frontend developer at two different companies before transitioning to backend development with Python. Now I'm doing frontend development aswell as backend development, with more emphasize on frontend as it's more fulfilling for me than backend development. 
<br />
<br />
I really love each day working as a developer as it is fulfilling, and I continue to enjoy building exciting projects in my free time. 👾
