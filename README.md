Meet Ward (30 years old), the digital adventurer who lives between the lines of his code. When he's not busy developing new software, you'll find him up high, chasing the next adrenaline rush through wakeboarding or climbing. When the adrenaline subsides, his mind remains active, enjoying building his latest projects, whether it's a website or an innovative game in his spare time.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ward's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey while playing FIFA and trading players, trying to profit of each sale. When you sell a player, you lose 5% of the sale, so I had to make sure I made more profit than 5%. I was tired of calculating it each time. So I wondered if I could make a small program that could do this. 1 bookread 'Head First Java' and a few weeks later I had my program that solved my problem. Since then I was hooked, excited about the possibilities of coding. I followed a course on freecodecamp.org and learned responsive web design (HTML, CSS). I quickly tried to get a job in IT. After a lot of emails, 1 company saw my potential and hired me as a software tester. I knew I was in the right sector. I decided to do a part of a bachelor's degree program in 2020, which thought me the basics of programming. After 2 years working as a tester, I graduated from the education and the company I worked for gave me the opportunity to work as a frontend developer. Worked +3 years in 2 different companies as a frontend developer, then I switched to backend (Python).
 I'm loving each day working as a developer, and building fun projects in my spare time 👾
